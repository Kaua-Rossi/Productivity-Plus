## 🏃‍♀️ Usage

This project uses Tailwind CSS. You need to compile the CSS file to see the styles applied correctly.

* To build the CSS once:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
* To watch for changes in `src/css/input.css` and automatically rebuild the output file:
    ```sh
    npm run watch
    ```
* To format all project files using Prettier:
    ```sh
    npm run format
    ```

After running the `build` or `watch` command, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the application.
